# Spotify Library Browser

A simple browser for your exported Spotify data. Zero dependencies, pure HTML/CSS/JS — nothing to install, nothing to build. All processing happens in your browser — your data never leaves your machine.

## Getting Your Data

1. Go to [spotify.com/account/privacy](https://www.spotify.com/account/privacy/) and log in
2. Scroll to "Download your data" and request your data (the **Account data** package — not Extended streaming history)
3. Spotify will email you when it's ready (usually a few days)
4. Download and unzip the file — you'll get a folder containing `YourLibrary.json` and one or more `Playlist1.json`, `Playlist2.json`, etc.

## Usage

Visit [the hosted site](https://danielhdzzz.github.io/spotify-data-view/) and drop your Spotify export folder (or the JSON files inside it) onto the upload area. You can also click to select files manually. Your data is processed entirely in the browser and is never sent anywhere.

After the first upload, your data is cached locally in your browser (IndexedDB) so the app loads instantly on return visits — no need to re-upload. You can clear the cache from Settings.

### Running locally (optional)

You can also clone the repo and place your exported JSON files into a `data/` folder next to `index.html`. The app detects the folder and loads your data automatically.

```
git clone <repo-url>
cd spotify-library-browser
mkdir data
cp ~/Downloads/my_spotify_data/*.json data/
python3 -m http.server 8888
```

Then open http://localhost:8888.

> A local server is needed because browsers block file loading from `file://` URLs for security reasons.
